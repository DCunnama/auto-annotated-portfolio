*Rising Star* is a 24-minute fulldome and virtual reality film that takes viewers on an immersive journey through the development and future of astronomy research in South Africa. As the first of its kind produced in Africa, the film highlights the country's remarkable astronomical facilities, including the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and the MeerKAT radio telescope. It introduces audiences to multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, aiming to inspire the next generation of astronomers and stimulate the production of locally-produced planetarium films. The film premiered at the Iziko Planetarium and Digital Dome in Cape Town and is accessible to all ages.
