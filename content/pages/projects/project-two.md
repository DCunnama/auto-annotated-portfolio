*The Cosmic Savannah* is a podcast I co-host and co-produce, showcasing the incredible astronomy being done across Africa. Through conversations with leading researchers and young scientists alike, we explore discoveries about our universe while spotlighting local voices and talent. With listeners around the globe, the podcast is both a storytelling platform and a tool for building pride, curiosity, and connection across the continent.
