*Sida Tsoatsoas — Our Beginning* is the first African-produced digital planetarium film to feature Indigenous African starlore. This 13-minute fulldome film combines live-action and animation to transport audiences to the iconic red dunes and expansive saltpans of the Kalahari in Southern Africa. It shares the unique storytelling techniques of the ǂKhomani people, offering insights into their culture and cosmic narratives. The film premiered at the Iziko Planetarium and Digital Dome in Cape Town in December 2021 and has since been distributed free of charge to an international network of over 4,000 planetaria. It was awarded Gold at the 2022 International Tourism Film Festival Africa in the Documentary and Television section under the category of History and Heritage .
